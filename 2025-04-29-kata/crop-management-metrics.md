**Core Yield Metrics**

- Yield per acre/hectare (bushels, tons, pounds)
- Crop quality grades and marketable yield
- Total seasonal production
- Yield stability over multiple seasons

**Economic Metrics**

- Revenue per acre/hectare
- Input cost per unit of yield
- Profit margin per crop
- Return on investment (ROI)
- Break-even yield

**Resource Efficiency Metrics**

- Water use efficiency (yield per unit of water)
- Fertilizer use efficiency (yield increase per unit of nutrient)
- Fuel/energy efficiency (yield per unit of energy input)
- Labor productivity (yield per labor hour)

**Biological & Environmental Metrics**

- Photosynthetic efficiency
- Harvest index (ratio of harvested product to total biomass)
- Soil organic matter trends
- Nutrient cycling efficiency
- Pest pressure and management efficacy
