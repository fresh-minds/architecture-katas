# Architecture Kata: AI Crop Management

## Business Case

FreshFarm Co., a regional alliance of small to medium-sized farms, needs a solution to optimize crop yields while reducing resource usage. Members face challenges with unpredictable weather patterns, pest management, 
and efficient water and fertilizer use. The cooperative seeks an AI-powered platform that enables data-driven farming decisions accessible to farmers with varying degrees of technical expertise.

## Users and Scale

1. **Farmers (200-300 users)**
    
    - Small to medium-sized farm operators
    - Various levels of technical proficiency
    - Access system through mobile devices and occasional desktop use
    - Need practical, actionable insights without complexity

2. **Agronomists (15-20 users)**
    
    - Technical advisors to the cooperative
    - Provide expertise on crop management decisions
    - Need detailed data analysis tools
    
3. **Cooperative Management (10-15 users)**
    
    - Coordinate resources across member farms
    - Need aggregate data for planning and reporting
    - Focus on overall productivity metrics

## Core Requirements

1. **AI-Powered Crop Monitoring**
    - Process drone and satellite imagery using computer vision
    - Detect early signs of crop diseases and pest infestations
    - Generate field health maps with problem area highlighting
    - Recommend intervention points based on detected patterns

2. **Predictive Analytics**
    - Forecast weather impacts on specific crop varieties
    - Predict optimal harvest windows based on multiple variables
    - Generate yield estimates using historical and current data
    - Identify potential risks before they impact crops

3. **Smart Resource Management**
    - Optimize irrigation schedules using soil moisture sensors and AI
    - Generate precision fertilizer application maps
    - Track resource usage and calculate efficiency metrics
    - Recommend resource allocation adjustments based on crop needs

4. **User-Friendly Interface** 
    - Provide actionable insights with minimal technical jargon
    - Visualize complex data through intuitive dashboards
    - Enable mobile access for in-field decision making
    - Include alert system for time-sensitive interventions

## Additional Requirements

1. **The system must function with partially offline capabilities for farms with limited connectivity, syncing data when connections are available.**
2. **AI models must adapt to local growing conditions and improve recommendations based on feedback and outcomes from previous growing seasons.**
3. **Solution must integrate with common farm equipment IoT sensors from at least three major agricultural equipment manufacturers.**
4. **The platform must include knowledge-sharing capabilities so successful strategies can be anonymized and shared across the cooperative.**
